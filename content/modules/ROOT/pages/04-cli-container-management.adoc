Now you will set up a new Grafana container, but this time, you will do
so through the Podman command line interface (CLI). Next, download and
start a Podman image for Grafana with this command:

[source,bash,run]
----
podman run -d --name=Grafana -p 3000:3000 docker.io/grafana/grafana:latest
----

Explanation of the command you just ran: * `+--name=Grafana+` specifies
the name of your container. * `+-p 3000:3000+` specifies that the
container should connect through the host’s port 3000 and the
container’s port 3000. * `+docker.io/grafana/grafana:latest+` is the URL
of the dockerfile that your container is based on. `+Grafana/grafana+`
is the name of the image and `+:latest+` indicates that you want the
most recent version. This allows Podman to retrieve the correct
container.

Finally, run this command to view your containers in Podman:

[source,bash,run]
----
podman ps
----

The output should look like this, although the Container ID will differ:
